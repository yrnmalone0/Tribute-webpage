#FCC: Tribute Page

#Description

This is my freeCodeCamp project challenge on creating a simple webpage which
was built with only HTML and CSS.

#Lessons Learned

I was able to understand a lot about HTML and CSS and what goes into 
building out a simple webpage. It took me some hours completing this project 
since it's my first time. I took my time to understand the syntax of both
HTML and CSS that will lead in creating well-formed and organized page.
